### Oh, you are actually looking here! ðŸ˜…

I am currently a doctoral candidate at the Technical University of Munich, developing, teaching, and researching software for multiphysics simulations. Since 2017, I am part of the amazing team developing [preCICE](https://github.com/precice/) and I am lucky to be advised by [Benjamin Uekermann](https://github.com/uekerman). Apart from the classical aspects of simulations, I particularly care about improving the user and developer experience of scientific software and advancing [research software engineering](https://de-rse.org/en/).

As I am currently busy with much more than coding, I would prefer to refer you to my [university webpage](https://www.in.tum.de/en/i05/people/personen/gerasimos-chourdakis/) for more details and latest updates.

For any preCICE-related questions, please use our [community channels](https://precice.org/community-channels.html). For anything else that I may be the right person to ask for help from, please don't hesitate to contact me via email.
